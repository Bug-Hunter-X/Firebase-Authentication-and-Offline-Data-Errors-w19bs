This repository contains example code demonstrating common errors encountered when using Firebase Authentication and offline persistence in JavaScript.  The `firebaseBug.js` file shows examples of improperly formatted email addresses causing authentication failures, and attempts to access data offline without proper handling. `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides solutions to these problems, including input validation for email addresses and handling offline data access gracefully.
