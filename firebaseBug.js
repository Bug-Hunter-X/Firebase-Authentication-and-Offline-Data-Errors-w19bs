The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an error if the user's email address is not properly formatted. This could occur if the email address contains unexpected characters or is missing the '@' symbol and the domain part.  Another issue arises when dealing with offline persistence. If the app tries to access data while offline and the data is not cached locally, it will fail and might not properly handle the offline state resulting in unexpected behaviour.
